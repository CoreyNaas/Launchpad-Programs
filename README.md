# Launchpad-Programs
Assignments from EETC 4213 and personal projects for the TI Launchpad TM4C123GH6. Projects I'm particularly proud of are in bold.

## Assignments
- Average
  - Finds the average of 10 numbers passed by reference.
- Average2
  - finds the average of 3 numbers passed-by-value through the stack.
- getSmallest
  - Given the starting address and number of words to check, find the smallest number stored, and return it in a register.
- NegPosZer
  - Iterates through a given block of memory and counts the number of negative numbers, zero numbers, nonzero positive numbers.
- **Lab6**
  - Takes in two memory addresses and counts the number of negative numbers, positive numbers, zeros stored within those addresses. Lab 6 is an implementation of the NegPosZer subroutine in a C wrapper program. 
   - Code: main.c, Count_Types.s
- **Lab8**
  - Emulates a dual traffic light sequence with blinking feature. Implementation of a FSM in ARM Assembly for the TI Launchpad.
   - Code: main.s   

## Personal Projects
  - **PePo**
    - (Peek/Poke) is a simple program that allows peeking and poking of device memory. Written in ARM asm and C because I wanted to see if I could do it. 
    - Code: main.c, back.s
